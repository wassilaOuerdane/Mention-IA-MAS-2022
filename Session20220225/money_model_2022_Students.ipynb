    "\n",
    "- One for multiagent platform: it will inherit the Mesa Model class;\n",
    "- The other for the agents: it will inherit the Mesa Agent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Model` class holds the model-level attributes, manages the agents, and generally handles the global level of our agent-based model (hence the same). Each instance of the `Model` class will make a specific run of the multi-agent system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Agent` class is characterized by a step method that implements the procedural loop. It will be called by the model’s scheduler at runtime for the agents to do whatever you have decided they should do. Agents can access to their model with the `self.mode` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *scheduler* is a specific component of the model that can be used to control the agent’s runtime. The Mesa platform runs in a synchronous manner and several classes are proposed to ease the scheduling process. They all have in common two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their constructor takes an instance of `Model` as parameter;\n",
    "- They all implement a `step` method that calls the `step` method of each agent once.\n",

We shall use the Mesa `MultiGrid` class that allows multiple agents to be in the same cell (as opposed to `SimpleGrid` which only allows one agent at a time in each cell). Its constructor receives `width` and `height` parameters, and a `boolean` as to whether the grid is toroidal.
